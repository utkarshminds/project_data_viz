# 2a - create virtual environment (separate container for libraries/packages/base python)

# 2b - git branch branchname 
# 2c - git checkout 

# 3 - modules, streamlit web pages - function calls, app secrets, usernames, passwords, 
#     api keys  

# 4 - test or run code on pc

# 5- requirements.txt (version of dependencies) 

# 6 - gitignore (files, folder to keep outside of staged changes)
